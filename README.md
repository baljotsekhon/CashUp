## Inspiration
The inspiration for CashUp came about while we were trying to find topics or problems that we face as 
college students on a daily basis that we wanted to tackle. As college students (and as humans), we often
have a tendency to throw away receipts that we later need or forget balances that we have remaining on gift cards.
CashUp allows the user to log their receipts and categorize them based on types of items purchased (food, clothing, etc.) and
stores.

## How We Built It
CashUp was created with Swift in XCode. 

## Challenges We Ran Into

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
This was the first that any of us had coded in Swift or developed an iOS app, but in the spirit of HackXX we were empowered to 
explore our passions for app development takle on a new challenge in a 24 hour time period.
